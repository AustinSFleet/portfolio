                    Raised in West Texas, I've been in the Hill Country for the past three years.I’m a full-stack developer, and recently I’ve been in sales for the Austin residential construction industry, specifically dealing with new home construction. Being in sales has taught me many things, I’ve learned a lot about time-management, specifically scheduling my own time to accomplish multiple tasks in a set amount of time. I’m an extremely quick learner that has fallen in love with coding, programming, and creating new things. I love the pay-off of a well crafted UI and the challenge that comes with developing a powerhouse back-end! I'm ready to put my skills to the test with any challenge you may have. Currently I am located in Cedar Park and would love to connect with you and hear about your experience.

                    Professionally, I have a lot of experience that you'll see in my <em>"skillsets"</em> tab. I have always worked in an agile development process, version control is always the top priority and I worked quite a bit with heroku as a deployment service. I always prefer to work on front-end development, and I would highly encourage you to check out my projects page. There you'll find projects that have been created in a strict three day time frame and for the most part the projects you'll find there were a day or two after learning the languages or frameworks implemented.
